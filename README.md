# collatz_conjecture
The Collatz Conjecture is an unsolved problems in mathematics
### What is it?
- Imagine you pick a number (7 in this case)  
- If the number is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1 (3 x 7 + 1 => 22)  
- If the number is even, divide by two (22/2 => 11)  
- As you repeat this process, eventually, the number will result to a 4,2,1 loop.

### What makes it unsolved?
- So, we know how it works for the number 7. Does this process result to 1 for all numbers?
- This is a tricky question because numbers are infinite
- If we test this on 1 trillion numbers and all of the numbers eventually come down to one, it doesn't mean all numbers follow this rule.
- 1 trillion is an infidesimally small percentage of infinity (yeah).

### Will it ever be solved?
- Probably not

The collatz conjucture might be considered a waste of time to study but cool visualizations can be made with it
